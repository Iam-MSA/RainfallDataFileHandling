# RainfallDataFileHandling

## Overview

The RainfallDataFileHandling project is a Java application that demonstrates the creation, storage, and consumption of rainfall data using subclasses of `java.io.Reader` and `java.io.Writer`. It provides functionality to create a rainfall data file by writing data to a text file using `java.io.Writer` subclasses and then read the data from the file using `java.io.Reader` subclasses, compute the average rainfall, and display the data.

The project consists of two main classes:

1. `RainfallDataWritter`: Creates a rainfall data file by writing the station name, district, and rainfall readings to a text file using `java.io.Writer` subclasses.
2. `RainfallDataReader`: Reads the rainfall data file, displays the data, computes the average rainfall, and provides the functionality to consume the data using `java.io.Reader` subclasses.

## Features

- Generate a rainfall data file with station name, district, and daily rainfall readings.
- Read the rainfall data file, display the data, and compute the average rainfall.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher installed
- Java IDE or text editor

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   https://github.com/IamMSA-01/RainfallDataFileHandling

2. Open the project in your Java IDE or text editor.

3. Build the project.

4. Run the RainfallDataWritter class to generate the rainfall data file.

5. Run the RainfallDataReader class to read the file, display the data, compute the average rainfall, and consume the data.

5. View the output in the console.
